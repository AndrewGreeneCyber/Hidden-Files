<h1>Change file permissions on a hidden file</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved using the chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt command to modify the permissions of the hidden file .project_x.txt. The owner now has read-only access, ensuring the file is not accidentally modified. The group also has read-only access, allowing authorized users to view the file without making changes. Others remain restricted from accessing the file, maintaining security. The updated permissions can be verified using the ls -la command.
